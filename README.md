# QuasR.io

QuasR is a software framework that allows developers to build cross-languages services easily. It provides automatic bindings for any library written in C/C++, D, Dart, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and many more.

## Getting started

Install the QuasR framework using node and npm (see https://nodejs.org) :
