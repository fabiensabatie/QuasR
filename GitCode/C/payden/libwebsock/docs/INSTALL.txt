To install websock, you will need libtool, autoconf, and automake.

Just run ./autogen.sh in the root directory of the page.

After running autogen.sh, if no errors are reported, you should be able to:

./configure && make && sudo make install

To use the library you must link against libwebsock and ssl.  For example,
to compile the test.c program in the root.

gcc test.c -o test -lwebsock -lssl
